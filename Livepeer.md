# What is the Livepeer Network

Livepeer is a decentralized video transcoding network that aims to enable cost effective, resilient, and censorship resistant video streaming.

Through storytelling, illustration, and data, the [Livepeer Primer](https://livepeer.org/primer) explains, at a high level, the problem Livepeer solves, and how it works.

# What is Livepeer Studio

[Livepeer Studio](https://livepeer.studio/) is the hosted gateway to the Livepeer Network and enables developers to quickly and easily integrate video capabilities such as live streaming, On Demand video, and video NFT minting into their applications. Developers can use [livepeer.js](https://livepeerjs.org/) or the [API](https://docs.livepeer.studio/) to build with Livepeer Studio.

<Section name="2. Building with On Demand" description="How to get started with On Demand">

# Uploading an Asset
   
   Livepeer Studio's On Demand functionality allows developers to upload and playback existing video assets. This allows your users to ensure that any videos played on your frontend are opitimized for playback by reducing start up time and adapting to your users bandwidth enviornment. Additionally, video assets can be optionally stored at IPFS, so you can easily mint NFTs. 


When uploading an asset using the API, there are two methods.

- Upload with URL (providing a downloadable URL)

- Upload with local storage (provide a `.mp4` file)

When using either the SDK or dashboard for uploading an asset, only providing a `.mp4` file with H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec is required.

9. Paste it into the 'Stream Key' field in OBS
10. Save changes and hit 'Start Streaming'
11. Navigate back to the stream page to view your stream!

The Studio API and SDK can help you build an application that uses this capability. Check out [our docs](https://docs.livepeer.studio/guides/live/create-a-livestream) to learn more or start building with the [SDK](https://livepeerjs.org/). 

   
# Other livestreaming features
