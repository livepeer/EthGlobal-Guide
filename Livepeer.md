## Uploading an Asset

> ‚ö†Ô∏è There are different ways to upload an asset (video & audio).

When uploading an asset using the API, there are two methods.

- Upload with URL (providing a downloadable URL)

- Upload with local storage (provide a `.mp4` file with H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec )

When using either the SDK or dashboard for uploading an asset, only providing a `.mp4` file with H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec is required.

### Question: T/F You can upload a video asset via the dashboard, sdk, or API?

## Deleting an Asset

When deleting assets in Livepeer Studio, it can only be done through the API at the moment using the following endpoint:

- DELETE `/multistream/target/{id}` deletes an existing multistream target object. Make sure to remove any references to the target on existing streams before actually deleting it from the API.

- Response should return `204 No Content`

- Deleting an asset manually

## Starting a livestreaming

Log in to the Livepeer Studio Dashboard
Navigate to the [Streams page](https://www.livepeer.studio/dashboard/streams).

 On this page, you can create new streams and delete them. You can also click on a stream to find out details about the stream such as:

- Ingest URL

- Playback URL

- Health Metrics

- Stream Key

## Recording a livestreaming

  You can record a livestream either throught the dashboard, SDK or the API.

  >Recording livestreams will only work if it is enabled before the live stream starts.

- Multistreaming

Livepeer Studio has the ability to multistream by pushing the livestream to multiple ingest points of other targets such as Twitch, YouTube and many others.

- Video Playback

In order to playback a livestream with the playbackURL, a video player has to be used that supports HLS format. Livepeer Studio has a video player included in the SDK for video playabck, or the playbackURL can be passed in the Safari browser as it supports HLS natively.

>If wanting to only play the audio of livestream, just add `?video=false` at the end of the playbackURL.

<!-- <Quiz id={} />

**QUESTION: T/F: Can you paste a playback URL in the browser to view the stream?**

False, you need a video player in order to view the livestream in the borwser. The only exception is using the Safari browser as it supports HLS natively. -->
